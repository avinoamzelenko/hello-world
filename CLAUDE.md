# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is **hello-world**, a personal introductory repository by Avinoam Zelenko. It serves as a first repository on GitHub and is currently minimal in scope.

## Repository Structure

```
hello-world/
├── CLAUDE.md   # AI assistant guidance (this file)
└── README.md   # Project description
```

There is no application code, build system, test framework, or CI/CD pipeline configured at this time.

## Development Workflow

- **Default branch:** `master`
- **Commit style:** Short, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Update README.md")
- **Branching:** Feature branches are used for changes (e.g., `claude/...` branches for AI-assisted work)

### Commands

No build, lint, or test commands are configured. When code is added to this repository, update this section with the relevant commands.

## Conventions

- Keep the repository simple and minimal
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- No external dependencies are currently in use

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hello-world
```

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is a starter repository with no code yet — confirm with the user before adding frameworks, languages, or tooling
- Always develop on the designated feature branch, not directly on `master`
- Update this file when significant structure or tooling is added to the project
